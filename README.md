Hello. My name is Ruslan, and I am the director of EkoDim Ukraine, a company with 8 years of experience in the installation of solar stations and other renewable energy sources. 
We have completed various projects, from small residential to large-scale industrial installations, as well as state orders. 
We have implemented projects on decentralization, monitoring of energy supply, and other advanced technologies to provide innovative solutions to our clients.

The war and bombings of energy facilities in Ukraine by Russia prompted us to rethink and reform the energy network. 
During the winter, Russia systematically attacked the energy system of Ukraine, destroying or damaging many transformer substations and distribution nodes for electricity. 
The attacks also targeted thermal power plants, leaving entire large cities like Kyiv without electricity and heat.

All of this pushed us to develop "EnergyDAO," a blockchain-based project that brings together renewable energy producers, traditional energy suppliers, consumers, and distribution operators on a single platform.

This union allows for solutions that are inaccessible to the existing (centralized) system, such as:
real-time tracking of the amount of generated energy and its consumption,
control of energy distribution and automatic disconnection of damaged areas,
information exchange and redistribution of electricity among all market participants.
"Green-oriented" companies can track the production, distribution, and consumption of renewable energy, which helps to ensure that energy is generated from renewable sources.

This project aims to make energy grids decentralized, meaning they are not dependent on a single source of energy.
Instead, the "Energy DAO" project introduces the concept of "honeycomb cells" which decentralize energy supply using renewable energy sources and energy storage systems.
We use modern energy accounting tools, combined with blockchain technology, to provide transparent recording of each step in the energy supply and consumption chain, which reduces the risk of fraud and corruption.

While this all looks good, it may seem utopian since it requires significant funding for implementation. 
One of the main barriers to the development of renewable energy sources is the high initial cost of their construction. 
Therefore, we have decided to start with financing, which does not depend on bureaucrats and political interests. 
We do not rely on funding from state or local budgets. We are implementing a working mechanism based on democracy and incentives for investors.

"EnergyDAO" can democratize access to financing for renewable energy projects and increase the amount of capital available for investment.

In fact, this is a crowdfunding platform where people pool their money to finance renewable energy projects.
We have taken the "Green Tariff" program, which worked in Ukraine before the war, as a basis. 
This program was designed to encourage industry and the population to install renewable energy sources. 
For example, investors could install solar power plants with their own funds and, thanks to long-term contracts for the purchase of electricity, recoup their investments and earn guaranteed and projected profits.

In this project, we have preserved these principles and gone further. "Energy DAO" crowdfunding allows partial ownership of assets, which reduces the entry barrier for small investors.

By launching this platform, we already have realized projects under the partial ownership program, and small investors are already receiving monthly income, income from the sun. 
We have 2 MW of installed capacity, but the potential for expanding the commercial solar power plant to 20 MW exists.
We also have signed agreements with industrial enterprises for a total capacity of 50 MW. 
Therefore, there is a large market for selling electricity generated from renewable energy sources.

Another advantage of this project is that it is easily scalable and can be deployed in any city and any country.

So, if you want to invest in renewable energy sources, you don't need to obtain permits and licenses, purchase equipment, and hire an installer company. 
It's enough to join the "Energy DAO" crowdfunding and choose the "Limited" or "Unlimited" investment program. (See more details in the presentation.)

                                                         We call this "Solar Mining"

 On the Energy DAO crowdfunding platform, you can simply buy the necessary kilowatts in the form of NFT and start earning from the next month.
 Please note that solar generation and therefore payments are not uniform throughout the year.
 
 However, average generation indicators can be easily seen in the presentation or calculated independently using the "Solar Resource Map GHI". 
 In addition, current generation and all history can be viewed in the personal account or in the "Energy DAO" application.

We adhere to democratic principles, so all decisions on the platform will be made by "Energy NFT" holders. 
After one year of owning an NFT, the holder will receive "EnDa Coins" in an amount that corresponds to the "NFT kilowatts". 
These coins will be used on the platform for voting and making various decisions.

We will provide more details on our social media, so be sure to subscribe so as not to miss the main updates!
